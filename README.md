# üöó DriveSense ‚Äì Driving Simulator Performance Analysis

**DriveSense** is a Python-based analytical toolkit designed to process and evaluate **driving simulator data**.  
It provides automated performance insights across key behavioral metrics such as lane-keeping, speed control, steering activity, and hazard response time.  

This project is intended for **data scientists, simulation researchers, and behavioral analysts** who need to quantify driver performance in controlled environments.

---

## üß† Project Overview

The driving simulator generates two primary data files per scenario:

1. **Simulator Output (.xlsx)** ‚Äì A time-series log of the driver's behavior  
   Contains timestamped records of:
   - Position coordinates (X, Z)
   - Speed
   - Steering angle
   - Timestamps

2. **Infrastructure Data (.csv)** ‚Äì Spatial map of the driving environment  
   Contains:
   - Feature type (tunnels, bridges, potholes, etc.)
   - Feature coordinates
   - Hazard event markers

The goal is to **combine and analyze** these datasets to extract KPIs and identify performance differences across **specific rule-based driving segments**.

---

## üß© Key Features

- **Automated Data Ingestion & Cleaning:**  
  Imports and synchronizes simulator and infrastructure data using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
  
- **Comprehensive KPI Computation:**  
  - Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP)  
  - Mean Speed and Speed Variance  
  - Steering Reversal Rate  
  - Lane Exceedances  
  - Hazard Reaction Time  

- **Rule-Based Segment Analysis:**  
  Dynamically defines segments such as:
  - ¬±100m around tunnels or bridges  
  - ¬±20m around specific hazards  
  - First-to-last feature occurrences (e.g., pothole field)  
  - Segments between paired objects (e.g., billboard sets)

- **Configurable Analysis Engine:**  
  Parameters like thresholds, segment distances, and event filters can be easily modified in the configuration block.

- **Readable Output Reports:**  
  Results are printed to the console and optionally saved as `.csv` or visualized.

| Metric                          | Description                               | Formula/Approach                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SDLP**                        | Standard Deviation of Lateral Position    | Measures lane-keeping ability by analyzing deviation in lateral position (Z-axis). |
| **Speed Variance & Mean Speed** | Consistency of longitudinal control       | Calculated using rolling mean and variance functions.                              |
| **Steering Reversal Rate**      | Frequency of steering direction changes   | Count sign changes in steering angle data.                                         |
| **Lane Exceedances**            | Number of times driver leaves lane bounds | Compare lateral position vs. lane threshold.                                       |
| **Hazard Reaction Time**        | Delay between hazard trigger and braking  | Timestamp difference between event and response.                                   |

## üß≠ Segment Analysis Rules

| Segment Type        | Rule Definition                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Tunnel / Bridge** | ¬±100m from start and end coordinate                    |
| **Single Event**    | ¬±20m around feature (e.g., merging traffic)            |
| **Pothole Field**   | Between first and last occurrence of ‚Äúpothole‚Äù feature |
| **Billboard Pair**  | Between the average X-coordinates of two billboards    |

All rules are defined in `segment_analysis.py` and can be edited or extended.

---

## üß∞ How It Works

1. **Load Data:**
   Simulator `.xlsx` and Infrastructure `.csv` are read into Pandas DataFrames.

2. **Clean & Synchronize:**

   * Remove duplicates and NaNs
   * Normalize timestamps
   * Align datasets based on coordinates or time

3. **Calculate KPIs:**
   Compute SDLP, speed metrics, and steering behavior using vectorized operations.

4. **Segment Analysis:**
   Dynamically detect regions of interest based on spatial rules and calculate KPIs per segment.

5. **Summarize & Export:**
   Print formatted metrics to console and optionally export `.csv` summary.

```

SDLP: 0.24 m
Steering Reversal Rate: 0.83 per sec
Lane Exceedances: 3

## üßë‚Äçüíª Developer Notes

* Ensure timestamps are consistent between both input files.
* SDLP can be sensitive to coordinate scaling; verify your simulator‚Äôs unit system (meters vs pixels).
* For hazard events, define the brake threshold (e.g., speed drop > 5 km/h within 2s).
* You can extend metrics by adding new functions under `metrics.py`.

---

## üß± Future Enhancements

* **Geospatial Visualization:** Display trajectories using Folium or Plotly.
* **Comparative Analysis:** Evaluate multiple drivers/scenarios statistically.
* **Automated Reports:** Export PDF or HTML summaries.
* **Machine Learning Insights:** Predict unsafe driving patterns using anomaly detection.
